Experiment_V1:
This experiment only uses policy agent on dynamic pricing scenario

Experiment_V2:
This experiment uses policy agent and model-based-RL on dynamic pricing scenario

Experiment_V3:
This experiment only uses policy agent on constant pricing scenario

Experiment_V4:
This experiment only uses policy agent with sparse rewards on constant pricing scenario. Here the sparse reward is every 50th time step.

Experiment_V5:
This experiment only uses policy agent with sparse rewards on constant pricing scenario. Here the sparse reward is every 20th time step

Experiment_V6:
This experiment uses policy agent and the learnt env model from dynamic pricing scenario for sparse rewards on constant pricing scenario. Here the sparse reward is every 20th time step
